# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📝 Overview

This project compares **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression** models for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.
The objective is to build an effective model that can help banks identify suspicious activity and reduce financial losses from fraud.

**Status:** ✅ Completed

---

## 🎯 Objective

A bank is struggling with its current fraud detection system and needs a **machine learning solution** to identify fraudulent transactions in real-time.
The model should:

* Analyze credit card usage patterns.
* Accurately flag potentially fraudulent transactions.
* Minimize false positives to avoid customer inconvenience.

## 🛠️ Methods & Tools

**Methods**

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest Classifier
* Data Exploration & Visualization

**Technologies**

* Python (Jupyter Notebook)
* Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 📂 Data Sources

* Public dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (included in this repository).

---

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition** – Import credit card fraud dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation** – Handle missing values, scale features, and address class imbalance.
3. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** – Explore transaction patterns and correlations.
4. **Modeling** – Train Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.
5. **Model Evaluation** – Compare performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
6. **Reporting** – Summarize results with visualizations and recommendations.

## 📈 Deliverables

* **Jupyter Notebook** with complete code, analysis, and results.
* **Visualizations** showing fraud detection patterns and model performance.
* **Summary report** for stakeholders.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Incorporate **real-time streaming detection** using tools like Apache Kafka.
* Use **deep learning models** (e.g., LSTM networks) for sequential transaction analysis.
* Apply **SMOTE or advanced resampling techniques** to improve handling of imbalanced datasets.
